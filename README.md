# CONECTA-4
During the ISDI Coders Bootcamp pre-course we were asked to develop a CONECT-4 game, using js vainilla and DOM. 

It was just a practice and at that time I was learning basic JS, without any kind of good practice nor js general knowledge. 

I really loved to develop this game and specially the logic behind the AI (Artificial Intelligence), it beats myself most of the time :)
